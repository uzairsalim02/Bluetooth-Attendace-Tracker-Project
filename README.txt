We have created some dummy rows to populate the databases in order to test functionality. List of dummy data is provided at the very bottom under DUMMY DATA.
Program will prompt the user to be able to do things like scan for bluetooth devices, read the data, modify it and even delete data.
Drop down menus, date selectors or text boxes will be populated to execute user selections.
We have made it easy for the user to be able to select functionality using Qt GUI.
